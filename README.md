# Retail Business Data Quality Analytics

## Overview
This project is part of my learning journey in data and business analytics.  
It focuses on understanding how data quality issues impact business reporting and how raw retail data can be transformed into reliable, decision-ready insights.

The project follows a practical, end-to-end analytics workflow using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and business relevance.

## Problem Statement
In real-world business environments, data often contains missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.  
If these issues are not addressed, analytical results and business decisions can become unreliable.

This project explores common data quality issues in retail sales data and demonstrates how they can be identified, cleaned, and validated during analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL
- Excel
- Power BI

---

## Project Architecture
The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. Raw retail sales data is sourced from CSV files.
2. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
3. SQL queries are used to generate business-level metrics and aggregations.
4. Excel is used for quick validation and summaries.
5. Power BI dashboards are created for interactive reporting and insights.

This workflow reflects a practical data analytics approach commonly used in business analysis.
