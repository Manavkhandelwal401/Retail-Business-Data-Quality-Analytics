# Retail Business Data Quality Analytics

## Overview
This project is part of my learning journey in data and business analytics.  
The main objective is to understand how data quality issues affect business reporting and how analytical tools can be used to convert raw retail data into meaningful insights.

The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and practical business understanding rather than only technical complexity.

## Problem Statement
In real-world business data, issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies are common.  
If not handled properly, these problems can lead to inaccurate analysis and poor decision-making.

This project explores common data quality issues in a retail dataset and demonstrates how they can be addressed during analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- SQL
- Excel
- Power BI

---

## Project Architecture
The project follows a simple and structured analytics workflow:

1. Raw retail data is explored and cleaned using Python.
2. SQL is used to generate business-level metrics and insights.
3. Excel is used for quick summaries and validation.
4. Power BI dashboards are created for interactive reporting.

This workflow represents a practical end-to-end analytics process.
